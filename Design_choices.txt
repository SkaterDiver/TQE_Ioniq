Design Choices

-----------------------------------------------------

Started by us wanting to make a new design of the pole trap, however there really were no big improvements 
that we could think of

Then considered building a penning trap, however it seemed even less effective than the standard pole trap 
since it could only hold a single ion

Then came the idea to make a surface trap. It was ambitious but had enough benefits to be worth the challenge

----------------------------------------------------

Surface trap design benefits:

- Easy to manufacture, electrodes are simple and lay on an isoelectronic base sheet and then can be sputtered,
spin coated or PEVCD.

- Scalable design, where new rows of them can be placed side by side on a chip, and then are easier to interface when
floating above the chip

----------------------------------------------------

Surface trap challenges:

- Need to do our own math to calculate the power estimate and the trap depth
	- calculated power estimate using capacitance formula for parallel plates rather than rods
	- trap depth formula stayed the same, but the COMSOL ion trap region might be less accurate

- Hypothetically lower trap depth, as ions are generally further from the electrodes and the field is weaker
	- means more sensitive to particles in the imperfect vacuum, or external electric fields

- Hard to determine the effect on efficiency, but could be potentially lower since stronger fields are required to trap 
the ions at similar depths (stronger field == more power)

- Really, really hard to make and simulate the perfect field conditions required to create the nested low potential zone
